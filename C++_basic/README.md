# `C++` Basics

`C++` is one of the most widely spread used programming languages on science. It will allow us to explore the terminal, and to run programs way faster than other programming languages such as python.


We will focus ourselves on `C++` for:

  - Solving differential equations.
  - Solving Ising Model - Monte Carlo.
  - Some other applications that would run slowly on python.
  
As `C++` does not plot, we will use as a complement sometimes `Python`, but most of all, `GNUplot`
